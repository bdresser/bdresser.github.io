		<p><strong>Hi, I'm Bobby</strong>. Welcome to my website. ðŸ‘‹</p>

		<p>My goal is to improve human wellbeing with technology. I help create
		digital products as a product manager and team builder. I'm particularly
		interested in the tools we use to organize and collaborate.</p>

		I'm currently <span style="background-color: #b7ffa9">head of product at Optimism</span>, an Ethereum L2 ecosystem designed to be accessible and sustainable.

		<p>I previously worked at <a href="https://github.com/" class="link">GitHub</a>, where I managed product teams responsible for Discussions, Sponsors, Profiles, and other tools for open source communities. From 2018-2020 I led product at <a href="https://metamask.io/" class='link'>MetaMask</a>, an open
		source cryptography tool and popular consumer crypto wallet. Before MetaMask, I worked
		at <a href="https://uport.me" class='link'>uPort</a>, building technical infrastructure for a decentralized
		identity system. In 2015 & 2016 I was at <a class='link' href="https://twitter.com/hfa">Hillary for America</a> as
		product manager for the campaign's online fundraising platforms.</p>

		<p>If you're interested in working together or want to talk about building on Optimism,
		send me an <a class='link' href="mailto:bobby@optimism.io">email</a> &mdash; I'd love to chat.<p>

		<p>I am available for occasional advising. See <a class="link" href="./consulting">this page</a> for details.</p>
